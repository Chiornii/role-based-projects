"When the “Download” button is pressed for a finished video, add a quality selection window (e.g., 480p / 720p / 1080p). It’s important to visually show the user that: Standard quality is free (and this is what they are downloading now), High quality (HD / Full HD) is available in the Premium version. A good implementation example can be seen in the Canva app (see screenshot canva_screenshot.jpg)."
Add an interface language selection option during the first app launch. This will improve the experience for new users and help increase retention across different countries.
"Place the video tutorial in a more visible location - either on the main screen or as a help icon during photo/video editing. This way, users can quickly understand how to use the main features without having to search for tutorials (it’s currently not obvious that such content exists in the settings)."
