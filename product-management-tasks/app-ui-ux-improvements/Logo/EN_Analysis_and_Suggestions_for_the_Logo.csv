"Option 1: (Main Concept) Mona Lisa’s face (see 1.jpg) - the image is divided by a thin white line diagonally, and from the center of this line a second dividing line extends toward the bottom-right corner. In the center of the icon, place a “Play” symbol (video playback sign). The left side of the image remains unchanged, while the right side is divided into two zones: - The upper area - blurred (blur effect). - The lower area - pixelated (mosaic effect). A similar implementation can be seen in examples 3.jpg and 4.jpg. Mona Lisa is a recognizable image associated with art and visual aesthetics. Her close-up works well for an icon, and the combination of a classic portrait with a modern “video” symbol emphasizes the concept of photo and video editing. Alternatively, the “Girl with a Pearl Earring” painting (see example 2.jpg) can be considered - it’s also easily recognizable and visually appealing."
"Option 2: The image is divided by a thin white diagonal line (a vertical line could also be considered). One half of the image has a blur effect, the other half a mosaic (pixelation) effect. A “Play” symbol is placed in the center of the composition. The image should remain recognizable by its shape and composition. Possible bases for the design: 1) “Mona Lisa” - see example 1.jpg, 2) “Girl with a Pearl Earring” - see example 2.jpg, 3) Any clear, recognizable object on a bright background - see example 5.jpg"
"Option 3: Use a photo with three people (see example 6.jpg). - The left person has a blur effect. - The right person has a pixelation effect. - The center person remains unchanged, in focus. A “Play” symbol is placed in the center of the composition, emphasizing the video editing idea. This approach creates a strong visual contrast between different editing effects and clearly conveys the app’s main concept - even without detailed recognition of the image."
"Various abstract icons and classic logo designs are not suitable for this app. Its functionality is minimal, and the goal is not brand promotion (where a classic logo would be appropriate), but the independent promotion of the app itself. Therefore, the logo should be as intuitive and instantly understandable as possible, catching the user’s attention at first glance."
