Project File Instructions

Each folder (Onboarding, Purchase Screen, and Logo) contains two files:

1. Word file - contains notes directly related to the designerâ€™s work, 
including layout descriptions and design instructions to be used for further visual development.

2. Excel (CSV) file - contains all my comments, analysis, reasoning, and suggestions for every aspect of the task. 
This file includes general ideas, research, and all the data used to form my recommendations.

Thus, the Word file focuses solely on the design part of the task, while the Excel (CSV) file covers all processed information and the overall project content.
